    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
in setting.py add MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

5 - 5 Displaying Objects
(because added url in personal_portfolio with different erl no racket)
to add home page in porfolio (possible as well to add at )
1. at personal_portfolio url, add :
    from portfolio import views.py
        path('', views.home, name='home'),
2. at portfolio views.py, add :
    from .models import Project
    def home(request):
        projects = Project.objects.all()
        return render(request, 'portfolio/home.html', {'projects': projects})
3. create home.html at porfolio/templates/portfolio folder

here is good description how to create home.html page, what's the content of this page

chellenge - add link on home page to all_blogs page
<a href="{% url 'blog:all_blogs' %}">Blog</a>     (strange but following link also working!):<a href="{{ '/blog' }}">Blog</a>
to show on how many blogs were written add <h2>JanaWasa has written {{ blogs.count }} blogs</h2>
, need to remove limiting number of blogs on page from blogs = Blog.objects.order_by('-date')[:5] into blogs = Blog.objects.order_by('-date')

google django template date format
was: <h5>{{ blog.date }}</h5> change into another date format: <h5>{{ blog.date|date:'d M Y'|upper }}</h5>

to reduce number of characters being displayed at all_blogs of blog description use this:
from <p>{{ blog.description }}</p> into <p>{{ blog.description|truncatechars:100 }}</p>

to remove html tags:
from <p>{{ blog.description|truncatechars:100 }}</p> into <p>{{ blog.description|striptags|truncatechars:100 }}</p>

add following def to class of models.py in portfolio and blog folders to change title of project titles in admin site

        return self.title
